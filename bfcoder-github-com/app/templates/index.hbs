      <h4>Barefeet</h4>
      <p>Yes indeed, I am a barefoot advocate. I started going barefoot in the Fall of 2010. I wear shoes on very few occasions, and not for long when I do. When I ride my motorcycle, I wear shoes. When I'm working with the horses, I wear shoes. When I'm working with power tools/machinery(lawn mower), I wear shoes. But pretty much other than that, I have nixed shoes. I especially dislike shoes with a heal. My wife owns no high heels. Period. I hiked all over Moab and Arches National Park while being barefoot. I've done 5 mile hikes through the mountains barefoot. I love being barefoot. I believe my body has strengthened itself since going barefoot. Back pains have gone, unless of course I have done something to incite pain. Like sleeping on a rock in the middle of my back I'm sure would incite pain. Barefeet FTW!</p>
